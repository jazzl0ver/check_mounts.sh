Summary
=======
Return 0 [OK] if true, 1 [WARNING] if mounted but has no matching entry in /etc/fstab and 2 [CRITICAL] if an /etc/fstab entry is not currently mounted.
Supports: NFS3, NFS4, CIFS, SMBFS and S3FS mounts.

Sample usage:
$ ./check_mounts.sh

OUTPUT:
/etc/fstab and /proc/mounts are not identical :(

Critical: these are not mounted but do appear in /etc/fstab:
+//10.0.0.3/my_vol /mnt/my_vol
